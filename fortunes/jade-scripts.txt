Because this is the "oh, no, you didn't say that" generation where a shocking comment has more weight then the truth.  No one has any shame anymore.  And we're supposed to celebrate it.  I saw a woman throw a used tampon at another woman last night on network television.  A network that bills itself as today's woman's channel.  Kids beat each oth blind and post it on YouTube.  I mean, do you remember when eating rats and maggots on "survivor" was shocking?  It all seems so quaint now.  I'm sure the girls from "2 girls 1 cup" are gonna have their own dating show on vh1 any day now.  I mean, why have a civilization anymore if we no longer are interested in being civilized?

America...  Has become a cruel and vicious place.  We reward the shallowest, the dumbest, the meanest, and the loudest.  We no longer have any common sense of decency.  No sense of shame.  There's no right and wrong.  The worst qualities in people are looked up to and celebrated.  Lying and spreading fear are fine as long as you make money doing it.  We've become a nation of slogan-saying, bile-spewing hate mongers.  We've lost our kindness.  We've lost our soul.  What have we become when we take the weakest in our society and we hold them up to be ridiculed and laughed at for our sport and entertainment?  Laughed at to the point where they would literally rather kill themselves then live with us anymore?
